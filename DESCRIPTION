Description: Evaluating the biasing impact of geographic features such as airports, cities, roads, rivers in datasets of coordinates based biological collection datasets, by Bayesian estimation of the parameters of a Poisson process. Enables also spatial visualization of sampling bias and includes a set of convenience functions for publication level plotting. Also available as shiny app.
